# tikz-graph-help

A plugin for Obsidian that lets you create tikz graphs using a simple to use menu. 

## Function 

This plugin aims to simplify the process of creating and edditing tikz diagrams. 
It includes a menu to create graphs using simplified selectors and input fields. 

### Upcoming 

- Support for 3D Plots
- Shapes
- Native tikz renderering
- Tikz syntax highlight 

## Notice 

The preview section only works in combination with the [TikZJax](https://github.com/kisonecat/tikzjax) Plugin by @artisticat1. I am working on a native tikz rendering solution, which is not yet ready.
