# tikz-graph-help

## Function 

This plugin aims to simplify the process of creating and edditing tikz diagrams. 
It includes a menu to create graphs using simplified selectors and input fields. 



## Notice 

The preview section only works in combination with the [TikZJax](https://github.com/kisonecat/tikzjax) Plugin by @artisticat1. I am working on a native tikz rendering solution, which is not yet ready.
